Rockin' all week with you

Won't you be mine? (Oh Happy Days)
This day is ours
Oh, please be mine (oh Happy Days)
Hello sunshine, goodbye rain
She's wearin' my school ring on a chain
She's my steady, I'm her man
I'm gonna love her all I can
This day is ours
Won't you be mine? (Oh Happy Days)
This day is ours
Oh, please be mine (oh Happy Days)
Gonna cruise her 'round the town
Show everybody what I've found
Rock 'n' roll with all my friends
Hopin' the music never ends
This day is ours
Won't you be mine? (Oh Happy Days)
This day is ours
Oh, please be mine (oh Happy Days)

Goodbye grey sky, hello blue
'Cause nothing can hold me when I hold you
It feels so right, can't be wrong
Rockin' and rollin' all week long
